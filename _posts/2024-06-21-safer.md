Maritime safety and efficiency are crucial for operations in busy ports like Singapore. The <ins>S</ins>ensemaking <ins>A</ins>nalytics <ins>F</ins>or maritime <ins>E</ins>vent <ins>R</ins>ecognition (SAFER) project was an analytics system built as a proof-of-concept from 2016-2018 collaboratively between Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and IBM Research Singapore. More recently, it was productionized for use by the authority. It was during the latter that I took on the role of a tech lead. 

SAFER allows automating and increasing the accuracy of critical tasks that previously relied on human observation, reporting, Very High Frequency (VHF) communication, and data entry. Towards fulfiling requirements from the user, the following features were desired from the analytics system:
- Detect vessels that went invisible to enforce navigational safety
- Detect vessels that are speeding in speed-restricted zones to allow for a targeted approach towards navigational safety 
- Detect vessels entering specific zones of interest to aid MPA in enforcing security by automatically identifying unauthorized entry into certain areas
- Detect vessels engaged in suspicious co-hangouts using vessel modeling to help MPA weed out oil siphoning activities, enhancing MPA’s reputation as a top bunkering port
- Predict vessel movement into zones of interest to enable MPA in proactively ensuring the security and safety of port waters
- Detect Drones in specific No-Fly-Zones to aid MPA in enforcing security
- Predict Drone movement into No-Fly-Zones to ensure safety and security
- a maritime entity resolution module to ensure that the vessel movement data used in the Sensemaking modules is correct

In this post, I discuss the data source, system architecture and explore some of the key use cases.

## The SAFER system design
SAFER operates as part of the larger Port Operations Control system, integrating real-time data streams and historical records to provide actionable insights. The system architecture is modular and data-driven, designed to scale with the demands of maritime operations.

### Data Sources:
- AIS (Automatic Identification System) data for vessel tracking: granular data about a vessel's whereabouts as well as details, with periodic timestamps

- Zone definitions, including speed-restricted and prohibited areas, as well as no-fly-zones

- Historical event data, such as known violations and vessel trajectories, for model and  algorithm level testing as well as model training

**Data Ingestion**: Processes live data coming in from  Vessel Traffic Information System (VTIS) 
- This data includes maritime traffic data, vessel particulars data and permits data.
- Each of these types of data were handled differently - traffic data handled real-time _and_ saved for persistence; other data stored to persistence for future reference.
- Consumption of this data was done through a mix of Kafka consumers and Kafka Streams consumers, depending on the usecase.

**Analytics Engine**: Constituted by the different modules that fulfil the business requirements
- The modules were deployed as Kubernetes pods for easier scaling and monitoring.
- These modules were a mix of rule-based models, statistical modeling and classical ML modeling.

**Alert System**:
- Once infringements were detected (by analyzing the incoming data), alerts were created and sent to the downstream Port Operations Control system.
- This was facilitated through a Kafka Producer embedded in each of the modules in the Analytics Engine.


While the analytics engine consisted of 10 modules, for the scope of this blog, let's consider two modules - Speeding and Vessel Prediction.



## Speeding Violations Module
Speeding in maritime zones can endanger vessels, cargo, and the environment. SAFER’s Speeding Violations module addresses this by detecting vessels that breach speed limits in predefined areas.

### How It Works

**Methodology**: 
- The module obtains vessel speed from the incoming data stream and flags violations when the speed continues to be above the speed limit for a pre-configured length of time, while the vessel is in a speed-restricted zone. 
- Additionally, there were special considerations for Patrol Crafts (in general) and Ferry Boats (in Ferry Terminals).

By automating the detection of speeding infringements, the module enhances safety and reduces reliance on human observation to report such infringements.

**Example**

| *A vessel exceeding the speed limit in a Speeding Zone is flagged and an alert is sent to the UI. The UI then displays them for the user for further action.* |


## Vessel Movement Prediction
MPA handles more than 1000 vessel movements daily in Singapore port waters. Predicting vessel movements into restricted or prohibited zones is critical for proactive maritime safety. The module was used for predicting vessel trajectories into prohibited, height-restricted, and sensitive areas which means that it concerns with relatively short-term prediction. The prediction is used to provide an early warning signal to MPA officers to take preemptive action. 

SAFER uses classical machine learning to predict and mitigate these risks.

### How It Works

**Methodology**:
- A $kernel-K\ Nearest\ Neighbor$ algorithm is trained on recent vessel trajectories. 
- A similarity metric is calculated on a representation of each vessel's recently observed trajectory. Using this similarity metric, $K$ most similar historical trajectories are identified. 
- The probability of entering each Zone of Interest is thus derived from the outcome of each similar historical trajectory and the degree of similarity of each to the current trajectory. The outcome here is simply whether a given trajectory entered a Zone of Interest or not.
- A trajectory is defined as the most recent 6 pairs of Lat-Lon locations in the past 1 minute. The model also predicts the time until entry, allowing for proactive measures. There are provisions to adjust thresholds to prioritize either recall (sensitivity) or precision (fewer false alarms), ensuring tailored responses to operational requirements.


This KNN model based predictive module was able to predict entry into areas of interest with an 82% recall and a 3% false alarm rate when tested against historical data.

**Example**
A container ship predicted to enter a Zone of Interest, within the next 2 minutes allows port authorities to issue timely warnings.

| *A vessel is predicted to enter a zone of interest (Changi Naval Base), based on its current trajectory. An alert is sent to the UI which then displays it for the user to take action.* |

The SAFER system exemplifies how data-driven insights can enhance maritime safety and operational efficiency. With a robust architecture, diverse data sources, and modules deployed for scale, SAFER provides actionable intelligence, allowing port authorities to act swiftly and effectively.

Shipping (no pun intended) out the SAFER system was a huge learning experience for me. I was part of initial workshops, led sprint reviews, was responsible for design decisions as well as integratings with external interfaces. This required me to engage with different stakeholders, often having to go beyond my formal scope of deliverables to ensure timely delivery of the project.
